                    <p>Personal Information may be collected when a user conducts activities on or related to all websites of ESAFE. Although information collected, used or disclosed on the Internet as described below may not constitute Personal Information. To the extent that such is the case, then the obligations under ESAFE Privacy Policy do not extend to such information.</p>
                    <ol class="orderlistDefault">
                        <li>Internet Protocol Address (IP Address) – When the user's web browser requests a web page from another computer on the internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where is should send the information. This address is called the computer’s "IP address". For most users accessing the internet from a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time the user logs on. ESAFE may use the user's IP Address to:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Facilitate the diagnosis and remedy of a technical problem reported by the user’s or ESAFE’s technical team.</li>
                                <li>Estimate user traffic from specific regions or organizations.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Cookies – When an individual visitor accesses the ESAFE website, we may use a browser feature called a ‘cookie’ to collect information such as the type of internet browser and operating system the visitor uses, the domain name of the website from which the visitor came, date and duration of the visit, number of visits, average time spent on our website, pages viewed and number of cookies accumulated.</li>
                        <li>Online Communications – In order to provide our website visitors with a service or information, visitors may voluntarily submit Personal Information to us for purposes such as asking a question, obtaining information, reviewing or downloading a publication, participating in a seminar or other event, and participating in contests and surveys. If you are known to ESAFE as a registered user of an online service, we may combine and store Personal Information about your use of our website and the online information you have provided with certain other online and offline information we may have collected.</li>
                        <li>E-Mail Communications – Occasionally, we may send marketing or promotional e-mail communications to you with information that may be useful, including information about the services of ESAFE and other third parties with whom we have a relationship.</li>
                        <li>Links – Our website may contain links to other websites which are provided as a convenience only. Visitors are advised that other third party websites may have different privacy policies and practices than ESAFE. ESAFE accepts no responsibility for the information provided to third party websites or the content of such websites.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3 id="question7">How can you Obtain Access to Your Personal Information?</h3>
                    <p>Upon your written request, and subject to certain exceptions, ESAFE will inform you of the existence, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information and will give you access to that information. Access requests should be sent to ESAFE’s Chief Privacy Officer using the contact information outlined below.</p>
                    <p>If access to your personal information is denied, ESAFE will notify you in writing, give reasons for the denial, and inform you of the recourses open to you. If access is granted, ESAFE will give you a reasonable opportunity to review you Personal Information. Your Personal Information will be provided to you in an understandable form within a reasonable time, generally within 30 days. ESAFE may extend such 30 day period by up to an additional 30 days if meeting the time limit would unreasonably interfere with the activities of ESAFE or the time required to undertake any consultations necessary to respond to your request would make the time limit impracticable to meet. You will be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of your Personal Information and have it amended as appropriate.</p>
                    <h3 id="question8">How can you Obtain Further Information Regarding this Policy?</h3>
